        <p>
            I'm a freelance consultant. I advise companies on how to build enterprise applications for complex business
            domains. As a team leader, I help developers to use best practices. I specialize in curing large legacy
            projects: writing tests for untestable code, refactoring to Domain Driven Design, and giving the
            applications a second life.
