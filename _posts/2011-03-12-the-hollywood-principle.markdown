Here's my new blog. I've been postponing it for nine months, because of these recognisable bumps in the road:



	
  * I wanted a cool design

	
  * I wanted to use some cool new app that stores the posts on GitHub

	
  * I wanted to write my own blog app in a framework or language I haven't tried yet

	
  * I wanted to write a bunch of blog posts before I start publishing them


So I ended up using WordPress, with the stock template, no pre-written posts, and an Emile Claus painting.

The Hollywood Principle is a methodology in Object Oriented design: "Don't call us, we'll call you". I choose after reading [an interesting discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/growing-object-oriented-software/7_fRrAjNBao/discussion) on the GOOS mailing list, which accompanies the book I'm reading: [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce.

So that should give you a clue: I intend to blog about OOP, quality assurance, continuous integration, but also PHP, the web, and, as blogs go, anything that comes to mind. Wish me luck.
