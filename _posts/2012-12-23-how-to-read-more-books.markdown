"You can't learn everything from books", people say. It's nothing but an excuse not to read books. It's a straw man argument,
because no-one has ever claimed that you can. Or, "knowledge from experience can't be taught in a book". Even though that's true,
there are many people out there with years of experiences that you will never have. Some of them are very good at sharing at least
some of that gained knowledge through writing. Books broaden your horizon, and deepen your insight.

With that out of the way, here are some of the tips that help me to read more books.

### Get glasses

If reading makes you tired, gives you headaches, or is generally uncomfortable, you may need glasses.

### Stop watching tv

When people tell me they don't have time to read books, I always ask if they have time to watch tv. You don't have to stop entirely,
but only watch things that you consciously choose to watch.

- Don't watch live television. Most programs last either 22 or 44 minutes, but that's 30 or 60 minutes with commercials. Watch recorded tv instead.
- Don't zap. The ultimate time sink hole.
- Don't watch the news. It's amways the same. The little information you can get from a 22 minute news program, can be read online in 5 minutes.

Which brings me to:

### Stop reading newspapers

Newspapers and magazines over here compete by getting fatter year after year, with declining quality as the result. Everything you read
will be outdated tomorrow anyway. And let's be honest: first you read the funnies, then the headers, then some celebrity
news. Do you really need a newspaper anymore?

### Get an e-reader

Or get two, or three. They're cheap, small, and light. They carry thousands of books. They're a pleasure to read, because
they don't blast bright light at you like iPads, monitors, and TV's. Rid yourself of the romantic idea that books must
 be touchable paper things that you can sniff. They're just dead trees collecting dust in your living room, and you'll be
 really sorry when you move to a new house.

### Read everywhere

Kindle has apps for every device, and syncs your progress. When I'm standing in line in the supermarket, I read a couple of
pages on my phone. I read in bed, in the bathroom, on lunch breaks, in transit, and when I'm early for a meeting.

### Make it a habit

I read when I'm too tired too read. Obviously, some of it gets lost, and I often need to reread the last couple of pages
the next day. I do it because I feel that even reading only a little bit, keeps the habit alive. That's also why I try to make
 sure I always have my next book lined up. Some e-book stores gives you the first chapter for free, which is great way to find
 out if a book is worth reading.

### Train your muscle

Like many things, the more you read, the easier it gets. Even if it's hard in the beginning, if you read daily, you'll find that
it gets easier, that you learn new concepts faster, that your brain gets more adapted to obtaining and processing information.

### Keep a list

Keep track of what you've read, on sites like [Kindle Reading List](https://kindle.amazon.com/), or [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/).
 You can share your list, follow others, turn it into a game. It's very rewarding to watch your reading list grow, realizing that all that
 knowledge is now in your head as well and makes you better at what you do.
