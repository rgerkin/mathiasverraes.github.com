"You can't learn everything from books", people say. It's nothing but an excuse not to read books. It's a straw man argument,
because no-one has ever claimed that you can. Or, "knowledge from experience can't be taught in a book". Even though that's true,
there are many people out there with years of experiences that you will never have. Some of them are very good at sharing at least
some of that gained knowledge through writing. Books broaden your horizon, and deepen your insight.


With that out of the way, here are some of the tips that help me to read more books.

### Get glasses

If reading makes you tired, gives you headaches, or is generally uncomfortable, you may need glasses.

### Stop watching tv

When people tell me they don't have time to read books, I always ask if they have time to watch tv. You don't have to stop entirely,
but only watch things that you consciously choose to watch.

- Don't watch live television. Most programs last either 22 or 44 minutes, but that's 30 or 60 minutes with commercials. Watch recorded tv instead.
- Don't zap. The ultimate time sink hole.
- Don't watch the news. It's always the same. The little information you can get from a 22 minute news program, can be read online in 5 minutes.

According to this [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli), news is not just a
waste of time, it is in fact really bad for you. Giving up reading news will make you happier.

Which brings me to:

### Stop reading newspapers

Newspapers and magazines over here compete by getting fatter year after year, with declining quality as the result. Everything you read
will be outdated tomorrow anyway. And let's be honest: first you read the funnies, then the headers, then some celebrity
news. Do you really need a newspaper anymore?

More generally, Gerald M. Weinberg wrote:

<blockquote>Never read anything that isn't worth reading.</blockquote>

### Get an e-reader

Or get two, or three. They're cheap, small, and light. They carry thousands of books. They're a pleasure to read, because
they don't blast bright light at you like iPads, monitors, and TV's. Rid yourself of the romantic idea that books must
 be touchable, sniffable, paper objects. They're just dead trees collecting dust in your living room, and you'll be
 really sorry when you move to a new house and have to carry them down four flights of stairs. The content is what matters.

### Read everywhere

Kindle has apps for every device, and syncs your progress. When I'm standing in line in the supermarket, I read a couple of
pages on my phone. I read in bed, in the bathroom, on lunch breaks, in transit, and when I'm early for a meeting.

### Make it a habit

I read when I'm too tired to read. Obviously, some of it gets lost, and I often need to reread the last couple of pages
the next day. I do it because I feel that even reading only a little bit, keeps the habit alive. That's also why I try to make
 sure I always have my next book lined up. Some e-book stores give you the first chapter for free, which is great way to find
 out if a book is worth reading.

### Train your muscle

Like many things, the more you read, the easier it gets. Even if it's hard in the beginning, if you read daily, you'll find that
it gets easier, that you learn new concepts faster, that your brain gets more adapted to obtaining and processing information.

### Keep a list

Keep track of what you've read, on sites like [Kindle Reading List](https://kindle.amazon.com/), or [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/).
 You can share your list, follow others, turn it into a game. It's very rewarding to watch your reading list grow, realizing that all that
 knowledge is now in your head as well and makes you better at what you do.

### Skip to a better book

[Nassim N. Taleb](http://verraes.net/2013/08/antifragile-nassim-nicholas-taleb/) spent years reading 30-60 hours a week:

<blockquote>"The minute I was bored with a book or a subject I moved to another one, instead of giving up on reading altogether (...)
The trick is to be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading."</blockquote>

### Start easy

If you have a backlog of books you want to read, you can start with an easy or short one and build your way up.
A finished book is a small victory that boosts your confidence, and prepares you for tougher tomes.

### Listen to audiobooks

I'd never given audiobooks much thought, but the last few months I've been driving a lot, so I wanted to spend the time well.
I finished my first two audiobooks -- easy and short ones to begin with. I find that I'm more relaxed and focused when driving with
 the gentle voice of a good narrator, than with blaring radio.

### Read it before you need it

In an ideal world, you'd read (technical) books just in time, precisely before you need the information. But you can't plan learning like that.
You don't know how much time you'll need to read it, let alone to have it sink in. When you need information to finish a task
you're working on, a book is often not the right choice.

A better approach is to read a book long before you might need it. Learning takes time, so giving your brain ample time to process the new
ideas, will give you a much better understanding. When the time comes to use the knowledge, a quick refresher will be all you need to
reactivate it in your brain.


### Make room and make options

[Jurgen Appelo](http://www.noop.nl/2013/12/dont-make-goals-make-room-and-make-options.html) recommends not to set a target
amount of books to read. Targets lead to sub-optimisation. And how would you know what amount is 'just right'? Focus on removing
waste (he cites watching TV and drinking in bars), and on making options (have a backlog and always bring reading material).

### Walk 'n' read

I've always felt walking was good for thinking and getting the creative juices flowing &ndash; back when I was a film music composer, that's how I came up with my best melodies. For the past few weeks, I've been trying something new: every morning, I take the same 45 minute walk, while reading on my Kindle. I'm taking small farmers' roads between the fields, so there's no traffic and it's safe. It's good for your health, so it's a double win. And if reading on the couch makes you drowsy, walking is the perfect remedy.

### Pomodoro

[@tvlooy](https://twitter.com/tvlooy/status/481500378362818560) uses the [Pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/): set an alarm, read for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break away from the book or screen, repeat ad lib, with the same or a different book. For the full Pomodoro experience, keep track of the finished (uninterrupted) reading sessions, and set goals.
